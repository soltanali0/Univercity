Projectile Motion Calculator

This repository contains a Python script that calculates various parameters for a projectile's motion, including the optimal launch angle, required initial velocity, time to collision, and maximum height. It utilizes the `scipy.optimize` library to find the optimal launch angle to achieve a desired target velocity.

How It Works

The script uses a simplified model of projectile motion with the following inputs:
- Geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) of the launch and landing locations.
- Altitude at launch and landing locations.
- Temperature at launch and landing locations.
- A target velocity to reach the destination.

The code consists of three main functions:
1. `calculate_initial_velocity`: Calculates the initial velocity required to reach the target velocity.
2. `calculate_time_to_collision`: Computes the time to collision based on the optimal launch angle and other parameters.
3. `calculate_max_height`: Determines the maximum height achieved during the projectile's motion.

The `scipy.optimize.minimize` function is used to find the optimal launch angle that minimizes the difference between the calculated initial velocity and the target velocity.

## Usage

To use this script, provide the necessary input parameters and run it. The optimal launch angle, required initial velocity, time to collision, and maximum height will be displayed as output.
